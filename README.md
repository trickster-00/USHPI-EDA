## Problem Statement:
### "Build a model using publicly available data for key supply-demand factors that could influence US home price. Use that to explain how these factors impacted home prices over the last ~20 years."

To provide solution for this problem I divided the problem into two parts. Before doing any Analysis, a lot of data had to be gathered and converted into a single dataframe. In order to accomplish this I did [Data Gathering](https://github.com/trickster-00/US_Home_prices/blob/ddcca71699e7752eb6bf06cd580395a2bdfa243e/Data%20Gathering.ipynb) where I gathered over 10 [Datasets](https://github.com/trickster-00/US_Home_prices/tree/main/Data) 

[Assignment (Part 1)]() : The First part where I tried to determine the key supply-demand factors that could influence US home price using publicly available.

[Assignment (Part 2)]() : The Second part where I worked to explain how these factors impacted home prices over the last 20 years.

All the solutions for the problem were provided in `.ipynb` files.
